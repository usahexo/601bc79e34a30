#  Benicio Del Toro to Star in Largest Casino Film Yet!

Benicio Del Toro is set to star in "The Man Who Sold the World", an upcoming casino movie. The film is expected to be the largest casino movie to date, with a budget of over $100 million.

"The Man Who Sold the World" will tell the story of a Las Vegas casino owner who gets into trouble with the mob. Del Toro will play the casino owner, while Charlize Theron is rumored to be in talks to play his love interest.

The film is being produced by Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions, and is expected to start shooting later this year.

#  World's Largest Casino to Open in Spain Next Month

The completion of the Eurovegas project, a $22.8 billion casino complex in Madrid, has been pushed back to next month according to developer Sheldon Adelson. The massive resort will span an area of 176 acres and include 36 hotels, four golf courses, and a theme park. It is expected to create 260,000 jobs when it opens.

The delay has been caused by the need for more environmental permits, but Adelson remains bullish on the prospects for Eurovegas. "There is no other place in Europe like this," he said at a press conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. "It's a game changer."

Adelson also brushed off concerns about the recent arrest of his son-in-law on drug trafficking charges. "This is a minor issue," he said. "It will have no impact whatsoever on Eurovegas."

When it is completed, Eurovegas will be the largest casino complex in the world, dwarfing even the Venetian Macau, which is currently the biggest with an area of 770,000 square feet.

#  Largest Casino in the World Set to Open in Macau

The Venetian Macau is scheduled to open on August 28, 2007. At 1,060,000 square feet it is the largest casino in the world. The $2.4 billion facility will also have the world's largest hotel with 3,000 rooms and suites. 

The Venetian Macau is a 40% joint venture between Las Vegas Sands Corporation and Hong Kong listed Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. It will be the fifth property of its kind for Las Vegas Sands following in the footsteps of properties in Las Vegas, Nevada; Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Singapore and Marina Bay Sands in Singapore which recently opened.

The resort boasts an impressive list of amenities which include a 300,000 square foot convention center, a 14-theater cinema complex and "The Grand Canal Shoppes" with 535,000 square feet of retail space. Outdoor features include a 975 foot long "Grand Canal" with gondolas and replica landmarks from Venice such as Saint Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge.

The casino will have gaming tables and slots numbering 6,800 as well as an anchor high limit salon and 78 VIP gaming salons. Located on Cotai Strip it is within easy reach of Hong Kong International Airport which is only a short distance away by ferry or light rail connection

The Largest Casino in the World is Coming to Las Vegas!

It was recently announced that the largest casino in the world will be coming to Las Vegas. The $4.8 billion project will be located on the site of the former Riviera Hotel and Casino and is expected to create over 8,000 jobs.

The new casino will be twice as large as any other casino in Las Vegas, with a total of 2.7 million square feet of gaming space. It will also feature a world-class hotel, a concert venue, and a massive shopping district.

Construction on the new casino is scheduled to begin in early 2020 and it is anticipated to open its doors in late 2022.

#  China Plans the World's Largest Casino

In a move that is sure to send shockwaves through the global gambling industry, Hong Kong-listed Imperial Pacific International Holdings Ltd. announced plans this week for the world's largest casino.

The mega-resort, which would be built on the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, would include 3,000 hotel rooms, a convention center, and a 18-hole golf course. But the real centerpiece of the project would be the casino itself, which would boast 350 table games and 1,500 slot machines.

The proposed $7 billion development has already come under fire from U.S. policymakers and gaming industry executives, who argue that it would put American workers out of jobs and siphon business away from more established casinos in places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City. "This is a direct assault on our economy and our workers," said Nevada Senator Harry Reid in a statement.

But Imperial Pacific CEO Mark Brown insists that his company's Saipan casino would actually create thousands of jobs on both sides of the Pacific. "This is not about taking jobs away from anyone," he said in a statement. "It's about creating new ones."

So far there is no word yet on when construction might begin or when the casino might open its doors to customers.
