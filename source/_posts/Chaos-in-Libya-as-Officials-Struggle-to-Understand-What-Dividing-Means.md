#  Chaos in Libya as Officials Struggle to Understand What Dividing Means

Since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been in a state of chaos as different groups have fought for control of the country. The latest turn in the conflict came last month when Khalifa Haftar, the military commander who leads the Libyan National Army (LNA), announced that he was splitting from the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli and would be governing eastern Libya instead.

The move has thrown Libya into further disarray, with officials struggles to understand what it means and what will happen next. Haftar's supporters say that this is a necessary step to restore order to the country, while opponents argue that it is simply another attempt by Haftar to seize power.

Adding to the confusion is the fact that there are multiple governments in Libya, each with its own competing interests. The UN-backed government in Tripoli is Supported by a coalition of militias known as the Libyan Dawn coalition, while Haftar's LNA is supported by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

The divisions have led to clashes between militia groups, and there is a real danger that this could lead to all-out civil war. The UN has warned that the conflict could spiral out of control and urged all sides to recommit to a political solution.

So far there has been little sign of that happening, and it seems likely that the situation will continue to deteriorate. Unless a political solution can be found, Libya looks set to remain locked in chaos for years to come.

#  Islamists Claim Victory as Libya Parties Scramble to Interpret Rules of Division

Almost as soon as the final votes were tallied, Islamist factions in Libya proclaimed their victory in the country’s first ever free and fair election. The secular National Forces Alliance (NFA), headed by former interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril, has conceded defeat and is now scrambling to interpret the rules of the election’s bizarre system of proportional representation.

The 200-member Congress will be divided into three blocs according to the proportion of votes each faction wins: 60 seats for the Islamists, 40 for the NFA, and 80 for independents. But what happens next is far from clear. The Islamists have already claimed they should get the first shot at forming a government because they won more than half of the seats, but there is no precedent for how this will work in practice.

Many observers are worried that this could lead to a power struggle between Islamist and secular factions, further destabilizing a country that is still recovering from last year’s civil war. The Islamists are also eager to implement Sharia law, which would likely alienate many Libyans who were happy to see the back of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

The NFA has urged the new Congress to form a national unity government that represents all Libyans, but it remains to be seen whether this is even possible given the deep divisions within society. One thing is for sure; after decades of dictatorship and civil war, Libya is finally heading down a path towards democracy.

#  Militias Battle for Control as Libyans Disagree on How to Divide the Country

As the Libyan civil war continues, militias have been battling for control of the country. This has resulted in a great deal of disagreement among Libyans on how to divide the country.

Some favor a federalist system in which each region has a great deal of autonomy. Others want a unitary system in which the entire country is ruled from Tripoli. And still others want to return to the traditional monarchy.

The conflict between these groups has resulted in violence and death. Civilians have been caught in the crossfire, and many have fled the country. In addition, the fighting has damaged infrastructure and hindered economic development.

The United Nations and other international organizations have been trying to mediate this conflict, but so far they have been unsuccessful. If a resolution is not found soon, Libya could break apart into several separate countries.

#  Libya edged Closer to Civil War as Parliament Debates How to Divide the Country

On Tuesday, the Libyan parliament debated a proposal to split the country into three autonomous regions. Eastern Libya, which is largely controlled by General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), would become a semi-autonomous region. The western region would remain under the control of the UN-backed government in Tripoli. A third region in the south would be ruled by tribal leaders.

The proposal was drafted by Abdullah Thini, the head of the eastern-based government, and supported by Haftar. It is seen as a way to end the ongoing conflict between the LNA and forces loyal to Tripoli.

The parliament has not yet voted on the proposal, but it is likely to pass since it has broad support from both factions. If it does pass, it will be sent to the UN for approval.

This is not the first time that a proposal to split Libya has been made. In February 2018, a similar proposal was made but it was rejected by the parliament.

The conflict in Libya began in 2011 after Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed. Since then, there have been six failed attempts at forming a national unity government.

#  Libyans Remain Divided on How to Move Forward After Ratifying Plan to Split their Country

Just days after ratifying a UN-backed plan to split their country in two, Libyans remain deeply divided on how to move forward.

The internationally-recognized parliament in Tobruk voted last week in favor of the proposal – which would see the creation of a federal government in Tripoli and a semi-autonomous region in the east – while the Islamist-backed General National Congress (GNC) in Tripoli rejected it.

“I don’t think it will work. It’s not going to be easy to implement,” said Fathi Majbari, an accountant from Benghazi who was among those protesting against the measure on Sunday.

Others see it as a much-needed step towards stability. “I think it is good because it will help us stop the war,” said Ezzedin al-Daghari, an engineer from Misrata.

Even if there is consensus on moving forward, many hurdles lie ahead. The newly appointed head of the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), Martin Kobler, has warned that “implementing this agreement will be very difficult, if not impossible” due to the deep divisions among Libyans.
