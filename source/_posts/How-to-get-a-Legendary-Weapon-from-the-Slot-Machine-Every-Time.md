#  How to cheat the slot machine and get legendary weapons every time!

In this article, I'm going to show you how to cheat the slot machine and get legendary weapons every time! 

The first step is to find a weapon you want to get from the slot machine. 
Once you have found the weapon you want, head over to the casino and start playing the slot machine until you get it. 

The key to cheating the slot machine is understanding how it works. The slot machine has a random number generator that determines which weapon you will get. However, if you play the slot machine enough times, you will eventually get the same weapon twice in a row. 

This is because the random number generator only chooses a new weapon once every few spins. By playing the slot machine enough times, you can manipulate the random number generator so that it chooses the same weapon two times in a row. 

Once you have two of the same weapons, simply exit out of the casino and re-enter. You will now have two of the same weapons, which means you can now keep playing until you get the legendary weapons you want!
