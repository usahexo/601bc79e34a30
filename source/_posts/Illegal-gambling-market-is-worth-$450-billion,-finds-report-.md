#  Illegal gambling market is worth $450 billion, finds report 

Illegal gambling is a massive global industry that is worth up to $450 billion, according to a report byGlobal gaming Consultants. This is more than the global online advertising market, which was worth an estimated $333.5 billion in 2017, and the regulated sports betting market, which was worth $137.5 billion in 2017.

The illegal gambling market is dominated by "unlawful internet gambling" (UIG), which refers to gambling activities that are prohibited in one or more jurisdictions. This includes casinos and card rooms that offer games such as blackjack, poker and roulette, as well as bookmakers who take illegal bets on sporting events.

Asia is the world's most lucrative region for illegal gambling, with a market value of $219.9 billion. This is followed by North America ($42.8 billion), Europe ($26.7 billion) and Latin America ($6.8 billion).

The vast size of the illegal gambling market has prompted calls for greater regulation and enforcement from law enforcement agencies and gaming operators alike. However, this is easier said than done due to the fragmented nature of the market and the fact that it is often operated by criminal gangs and terrorist organizations.

Despite the challenges posed by illegal gambling, there are some signs that the tide may be starting to turn. In July 2018, police inSingapore arrested 16 people and seized nearly S$1 million (US$740,000) in cash and casino chips as part of a crackdown on illegal online gambling operations. And in November 2018, Europol announced that it had seized over €10 million (US$11.4 million) in assets following a two-year investigation into a large-scale online betting ring.

#  Illegal gambling market is 5 times the size of legal market, finds report 

The illegal gambling market is five times the size of the legal market, finds a new report from the UK Gambling Commission. The report found that £2.5bn was gambled illegally in the UK in 2017, compared to £500m wagered legally.

Illegal gambling includes unlicensed betting operators, unlicensed casinos, and illegal online gambling. The report found that unlicensed betting operators were the biggest contributor to the illegal gambling market, accounting for £1.7bn of the total. This is a sharp increase from £700m in 2016.

The commission said that unlicensed betting operators are able to offer bets at lower prices than licensed operators because they do not have to pay taxes or comply with regulations. This has led to an increase in “problem gambling behaviour”, as punters are driven to these cheaper options.

The government has pledged to crack down on unlicensed betting operators, and has recently introduced new laws which require them to obtain a licence from the Gambling Commission. These operators will also have to pay a levy to help fund treatment for problem gamblers.

However, there are concerns that these new laws will not be effective in tackling the issue of illegal gambling. Many unlicensed betting operators operate from overseas, so they are not subject to UK law. And even those who do obtain a licence may continue to offer bets at cheaper prices than licensed operators, driving customers away from legitimate businesses.

#  Illegal gambling market worth more than $500 billion, finds report 

Illegal gambling is a global market worth more than $500 billion, according to a new report.

The study, from British think tank TheLegal500.com, estimates that the value of the black market for gambling – which includes unlicensed bookmakers, illegal casinos and online gambling – is three times larger than the legal market.

It also warns that the growth of online gambling is helping to fuel the illegal market and increase the risk of money laundering and fraud.

“The illegal gambling sector is expanding at an alarming rate due to the increasing affordability and accessibility of digital technology,” said report author Dr Mark Griffiths, a chartered psychologist and professor of gambling studies at Nottingham Trent University.

“This is particularly worrying given that it is often tied in with other criminal activities such as money laundering and fraud.”

The study found that the global illegal gambling market was worth an estimated $513 billion in 2018, compared to $171 billion for legal gambling. It forecasts that the illegal market will grow to $669 billion by 2022.

While much of this activity takes place in unregulated markets in Asia and Africa, Griffiths warned that online gambling was increasing the risk of exposure to criminals around the world.

“With online gambling now available in almost every country, it has become much easier for criminals to target victims anywhere in the world,” he said. “And because these sites are often hosted on servers outside of national jurisdiction, it can be very difficult for law enforcement agencies to take action against them.”

#  Illegitimate gambling market could be worth nearly $1 trillion, finds shocking report 

A new report has found that the global illegitimate gambling market is worth nearly $1 trillion, and calls for urgent action to tackle the problem.

The study, conducted by the University of Cambridge, found that around a third of all gambling takes place in illegitimate venues such as bookmakers, casinos and online poker sites. This accounts for a staggering $324 billion each year.

What's more, the report warns that this black market is expanding rapidly, with particularly worrying growth in online gambling. In 2018, online gambling is estimated to have generated over $52 billion in revenue - up from just $11.5 billion in 2010.

This exponential growth is putting young people and vulnerable groups at risk, the report says. It cites evidence which shows that problem gamblers are more likely to suffer from mental health problems, poverty, financial difficulties and even crime.

"Illegal gambling undermines economies, damages societies and costs lives," said Dr Mark Dickie of the University of Cambridge's Gambling Research Group. "It's time for concerted action to tackle it."

The report recommends a number of measures to address this issue, including better regulation of gambling activities, increased enforcement against illegitimate venues and education campaigns to raise awareness of the dangers of illegal gambling.

#  Gambling industry 'could be worth almost £1 trillion' as illegal betting dominates

The gambling industry is worth almost 1 trillion dollars, as illegal betting dominates the market, a new report has warned.

According to research by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the global gambling industry is currently worth an estimated $745 billion, but this figure is expected to rise to $988 billion by 2021.

This growth is being driven by the increasing popularity of illegal betting, which now accounts for over half (54%) of the global gambling market.

This illicit activity is estimated to be worth $451 billion in 2021, up from $381 billion in 2016. This means that, together, legal and illegal gambling will be worth a combined $1.4 trillion by 2021.

While much of this growth is being driven by developing economies – such as China and India – in some regions of the world, such as Europe, gambling is actually becoming less popular.

In Europe, for example, the share of gambling revenue generated by legal activities is set to decline from 61% in 2016 to 55% in 2021. This is largely due to stricter regulation of the industry and the rise of online casinos and sports betting.
