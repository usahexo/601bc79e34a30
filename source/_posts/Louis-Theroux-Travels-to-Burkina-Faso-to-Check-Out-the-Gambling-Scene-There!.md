Theroux interviews several of the women who visit the casino, and he learns about their motivations for gambling. Many of the women say that they enjoy the thrill of gambling, and they appreciate the opportunity to socialize with other women in a safe environment.

Theroux also speaks with the owner of the casino, who explains that he opened it because he saw a need for it. He says that women in Burkina Faso often have limited opportunities to socialize and have fun, so he wanted to create a place where they could do both.
