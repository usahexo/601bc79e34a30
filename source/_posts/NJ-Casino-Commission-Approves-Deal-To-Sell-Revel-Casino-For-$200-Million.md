#  NJ Casino Commission Approves Deal To Sell Revel Casino For $200 Million

The New Jersey Casino Control Commission unanimously approved the sale of Revel Casino for $200 million on Thursday, September 25th. The casino will be purchased by Glenn Straub, a Polo Ralph Lauren executive and Florida developer.

This is great news for Atlantic City, which has been struggling in recent years with competition from casinos in neighboring states. The sale of Revel Casino will help to stabilize the gaming industry in Atlantic City and could lead to more investments and job growth in the city.

Revel Casino has been plagued by financial problems since it opened in April 2012. The casino has failed to turn a profit and has had to lay off workers and close portions of its business.

Glenn Straub plans to reopen Revel Casino under the name "TEN" and make significant investments in the property. He has promised to add 1,000 jobs to the casino's current workforce of 3,100 employees.

Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian welcomed the news of the sale, calling it a "great day for Atlantic City." He said that he was looking forward to working with Glenn Straub to make sure that Revel Casino is a success.

The approval of the sale by the NJ Casino Control Commission marks an important step forward for Atlantic City's gaming industry. With Glenn Straub's commitment to invest in the property and create jobs, Revel Casino is poised for a bright future.

#  Florida Developer Plans To Turn Revel Casino Into Waterpark

The Florida developer behind the controversial SunCruz casino boat chain has announced plans to turn Atlantic City's abandoned Revel casino into a waterpark.

The $2.4 billion Revel, which closed in 2014 after just over two years of operation, will be reborn as "Wonder Waterpark" under the management of Glenn Straub, who bought the property out of bankruptcy for $82 million earlier this year.

Straub has already submitted demolition permits for the Revel's vacant 11-story towers and is promising an ambitious project that will include a wave pool, lazy river, water slides, and a 400-room hotel.

The planned waterpark would be one of a kind on the East Coast and could potentially help revive tourism in Atlantic City, which has been battered by competition from casinos in neighboring states.

#  Revel Casino Closure Signals Grim Future For Atlantic City

The closure of the Revel Casino this week has signaled a grim future for Atlantic City. The casino, which cost $2.4 billion to build, only managed to stay open for two years before filing for bankruptcy and now being sold for just $90 million. This is another in a long line of closures for Atlantic City, which has lost over half of its casinos in the past decade.

Revel was supposed to be the hope for Atlantic City's turnaround, but it failed miserably. This is due in part to the fact that it was located far from the Boardwalk and other casinos, requiring people to take a shuttle bus or drive there. It also didn't help that Revel was extremely expensive to visit, with high hotel rates and no comps for players.

The closure of Revel is a clear sign that Atlantic City is in trouble. The city may be able to hang on for a while longer, but it is only a matter of time until it completely collapses.

#  AC Mayor: We Will Not Give Up On Revel Casino

Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian said his city will not give up on the shuttered Revel Casino, but also will not invest any more money in it.

The $2.4 billion casino, which opened in 2012, closed its doors in September 2014 after just over two years of operation.

“We are not going to give up on Revel,” Guardian said. “But we are not going to put any more money into it.”

Guardian made the comments Wednesday during a meeting of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority board.

Revel’s owners, California-based investment company TEN Atlantic City LLC, filed for bankruptcy in February. That move followed a failed attempt by Georgia developer Glenn Straub to buy Revel out of bankruptcy for $90 million.

Straub has since proposed a $300 million project that would include a smaller casino, 350 hotel rooms and 100 condominiums at the shuttered property. But the judge presiding over Revel’s bankruptcy has yet to rule on whether that plan can move forward.

In the meantime, Guardian said he is working with state and county officials to come up with a plan for the property that does not involve a casino.
