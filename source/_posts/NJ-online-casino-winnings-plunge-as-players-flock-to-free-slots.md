#  NJ online casino winnings plunge as players flock to free slots

With the proliferation of free slot games, it’s no wonder NJ online casino winnings have plummeted in recent years. The amount wagered on slots at the state’s regulated casinos fell by 16 percent in 2017, while online poker and table games revenue both rose.

This comes as no surprise to experts, who have long predicted that free slot games – offered by both land-based and online casinos – would cannibalize revenue from traditional slots.

The trend is even more pronounced in other states. In Pennsylvania, for example, casinos saw a 14 percent decrease in slot revenue last year, while table game revenue increased by 5 percent.

The popularity of free slots apps is also surging. A study by research firm App Annie found that the number of people playing casino games on their phones quadrupled between 2013 and 2017. In total, over $1 billion was wagered on mobile casino games last year.

So what’s behind this shift to free slots? For many players, it’s simply a matter of convenience. Rather than having to drive to a casino or wait for a seat at a blackjack table, they can now play from the comfort of their own home.

Players can also enjoy a wider variety of games at no cost, something that brick-and-mortar casinos are struggling to compete with. Many online casinos offer hundreds of different slots titles, compared to just a handful at most brick-and-mortar establishments.

For many players, free slots also provide an introduction to the world of gambling. By playing for free, they can learn the rules and develop strategies without risking any real money. Once they feel comfortable with the game mechanics, they can then start playing for real money bets.

Whatever the reasons for the shift to free slots, it looks like this trend is here to stay. Casino operators need to find new ways to lure players back to their machines if they want to reverse this downward trend.

Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games in the world. In casinos, they take up a significant amount of space, partly because they are so popular with players. Many people enjoy playing slot machines and they can be a lot of fun. However, there is a downside to playing these games - they can be very costly. In fact, it is estimated that the average person loses around $600 on free slot machines each year. So, what is behind this huge loss and why do people continue to play them? Let's explore this further.


The lure of slot machines comes from their simplicity and the potential for big payouts. These games are based on chance rather than skill, which means that anyone has a chance of winning big. This is what attracts many players, who hope to hit the jackpot and walk away with a fortune. Unfortunately, the odds of doing this are quite low and most people end up losing money instead. Another reason for this high loss is that slot machines tend to have high House Edges - the percentage of each bet that the casino keeps as profit. This means that players have little chance of winning in the long run and are more likely to lose money.




So, why do people continue to play slot machines if they know that they are likely to lose money? There are several reasons for this. Firstly, many people enjoy the excitement and anticipation that comes with playing these games. Slot machines can be very addictive and some players find it hard to stop once they start. Secondly, some people believe that they can beat the odds and win big sums of money. They think that it's only a matter of time before they hit the jackpot and this keeps them coming back for more. Finally, some people simply enjoy gambling and don't care whether they win or lose money. They see it as an opportunity to have some fun and try their luck at beating the house edge.

#  Gambling losses top $1B for first time in Ontario

TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA (June 21, 2019) Gambling losses in Ontario topped $1 billion for the first time last year as problem gamblers continued to fuel an industry that is growing in size and profitability.

The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) released its 2018-19 annual report Thursday, showing that gambling losses grew by 3.5 per cent from the year before to $1.04 billion.

It was the eighth consecutive year that gambling losses increased in the province.

“These numbers are staggering and show just how corrosive gambling can be on individuals, families and communities,” said France Gelinas, NDP MPP for Nickel Belt.

According to OLG, problem gamblers account for about seven per cent of total gambling losses — or $73 million last year. That’s up from $68 million in 2017-18.

The number of people who identified themselves as problem gamblers grew by 2.5 per cent to reach 192,000 last year.

Gelinas said there are too many loopholes in the system that allow people to continue to gamble away their hard-earned money. She called for a return of slot machines to racetracks, expanded hours of betting at casinos and more spending on awareness and prevention programs.

“Problem gambling is a serious issue that is only going to get worse if we don’t take steps now to address it,” she said.

#  Rhode Island takes biggest hit in New England from gambling exodus

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) Rhode Island is one of the states taking the biggest hit in New England from people gambling less, and officials are trying to figure out why.

The Providence Journal reports that gross gambling revenue in the Ocean State has dropped by $138 million since 2012. That's a 22 percent decline.

The newspaper says Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine all have seen gambling revenue rise during that time.

Democratic state Rep. Robert Craven says one of the explanations may be that Rhode Islanders are going to casinos in other states. He's calling for a study on the issue.

Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo is suggesting the state make it easier for people to gamble online. She says that could help offset any losses from gamblers skipping over Rhode Island casinos.

#  Atlantic City casinos take a tumble, but blame game starts

Atlantic City casinos took in $2.48 billion from gamblers last year, but that was down 8.5 percent from 2016, according to newly released data from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.

The Borgata led the way with nearly $1 billion in gaming revenue, but that was down 9.4 percent from the prior year.

Revel Casino came in second with $308 million, down 11.8 percent from 2016.

Trump Taj Mahal brought up the rear with just over $100 million in revenue, down 17.8 percent from the prior year.

The numbers were released as resort casinos continue to spar over who is to blame for Atlantic City's struggling casino industry.

The Borgata and Revel Casino have each sued Trump Entertainment Resorts, accusing it of trying to drive them out of business by not renewing their leases and closing the Trump Taj Mahal in October 2016.

Trump Entertainment Resorts has denied the allegations and said it closed the Taj Mahal because it could not find a suitable buyer for it.
